# CSV-to-Chart-Image-Converter-stramlit-app
Convert CSV chart data into line graph images for pattern recognition in trading analysis. Seamless integration with AI Image Classifier for automated pattern classification.


#### Overview:
The CSV to Chart Image Converter is a Python-based project aimed at converting CSV files containing chart data into line graphs. Unlike typical charting tools, this project does not include any grading, labels, or axes on the generated line graphs. The primary purpose is to transform raw chart data into visual representations, which are then saved as image files.

#### Motivation:
This tool serves as a preparatory step for another project involving an AI model for pattern recognition in trading data. In trading analysis, recognizing patterns within extensive datasets is crucial for making informed decisions. Traditional methods of pattern identification may not be efficient for large-scale data analysis. Hence, by converting CSV chart data into image patterns, we pave the way for the utilization of advanced AI models capable of classifying complex trading patterns.

#### Usage:
1. **Upload CSV Files:** Users can upload one or multiple CSV files containing chart data.
2. **Display Options:**
    - **Preview Graph:** View a preview of the generated line graphs.
    - **Preview Table:** View the data tables corresponding to the uploaded CSV files.
3. **Graph Export:**
    - Users have the option to download all generated graph images at once.


#### Future Scope:
Integration with the AI Image Classifier project ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Ahmed-Sleem/ai-image-classifier-with-custom-image-categories-and-streamlit-gui)) to facilitate pattern recognition in trading data. By feeding the generated chart images into the AI model, users can automate the process of identifying and classifying various trading patterns, enhancing trading strategies and decision-making processes.
